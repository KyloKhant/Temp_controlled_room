Temperature-Controlled Room System using DHT11

This project is a simple automatic temperature control system built using an Arduino and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The system monitors room conditions in real time and controls cooling or heating based on a fixed temperature threshold.

Overview:

DHT11 sensor: measures temperature and humidity.

When the temperature is above 23°C, a fan system is activated by rotating a servo motor and spinning a DC motor.

When the temperature is below 23°C, a heater is turned on, represented by three red LEDs.

The LCD display shows real-time temperature and humidity values.

Components Used:

- DHT11 sensor

- 3 red LEDs

- servo motor

- L293D motor driver

- 3-6V DC motor

- LCD Display
